# Dune Monorepo Bench

A large monorepo project for the purposes of benchmarking dune built from
packages in the opam repository.

The eventual goal is to get this to run on dune PRs to detect performance
regressions on a monorepo.

Benchmarks are run
[here](https://autumn.ocamllabs.io/gridbugs/dune-monorepo-bench).
